STEP 1
- Write tests and documentation for App:
	- Controller::__invoke()
- Finalize the documentation:
	- nginx: https://docs.koseven.ga/guide/kohana/tutorials/clean-urls
	- Controllers & Actions
	- Views
	- Database
	- Configuration
    - Exception handling
    - "\Controller\\" should be "\\Controller\\"
    - (Cron) Tasks
- Tips & Tricks
	- Performance tweaks:
		- Help composer by manually including Gaslawork files
		- Composer optimize
- Go though the code:
	- Can some methods be improved or split apart?
	- Add comments on methods and classes
- Add to Packagist


STEP 2
- Documentation
	- Write about all the things that are missing in the documentation
	- Maybe the documentation can be more fun?
- A way of fetching the request body. Request::getBody() maybe.
- Even faster - less dynamic - routes
- A REST Route and Controller
- Fetching and setting HTTP header(s)
- Method for checking if CLI
- Methos for checking if AJAX


STEP 3
- Response::redirect($location, $status = 302) // Is 302 correct?
	- Also throw Halt (or Stop?) exception that is catched internally
- Response::forbidden()
- Response::json()
	- Content-Type: application/json
	- JSON encode
	- JSON exception on failure
- Request::jsonBody()? Request::getJsonBody()?
- Container::__construct(array $entries = null)?


TESTS TO WRITE:
- Controller:
	- Fetch dependency via controller
	- Fetch dependency that does not exist via controller
- App::validControllerPath()
- Using param in handler with and without mod.


DOCUMENTATION TO WRITE:
- Using Route("/:directory/:controller/", "\\Controller\\{+directory}\\{+controller}")
